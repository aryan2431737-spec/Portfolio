  ðŸŽ¨ I bring creativity and expression into code, blending design with functionality to deliver intuitive and engaging user experiences.<br><br>

  âœ¨ <strong>UI/UX Design Thinking</strong>: I apply principles of user-centered design to build layouts that are not just visually appealing but also intuitive, accessible, and user-friendly. I focus on consistency, spacing, color harmony, and readability.<br><br>

  âœ¨ <strong>Wireframing & Prototyping</strong>: Skilled in tools like <strong>Figma</strong> and <strong>Canva</strong> for rapid wireframing and prototyping. I visualize workflows and interfaces before jumping into code, ensuring alignment with user goals.<br><br>

  âœ¨ <strong>Typography & Visual Hierarchy</strong>: I understand how type, spacing, and layout can guide user attention. I create interfaces that communicate clearly and look professional across screen sizes.<br><br>

  âœ¨ <strong>Clean & Expressive Code</strong>: I write semantic, modular HTML and CSS thatâ€™s easy to read and maintain. Every block of code is written with clarity and purpose, making future updates seamless.<br><br>

  âœ¨ <strong>Animations & Microinteractions</strong>: I use CSS transitions and subtle animations to enhance interactivity and delight the user â€” without compromising performance.<br><br>

  âœ¨ <strong>Storytelling through Design</strong>: My goal is to build interfaces that tell a story â€” from the first scroll to the last click. I believe in emotionally intelligent interfaces that feel natural and human.<br><br>

  ðŸŒŸ I view coding as a form of creative expression and continuously experiment with design techniques to push boundaries and delight users.
