        <h1>More About Me</h1>
        <p>
        <p>🎓 I’m currently pursuing my Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) from Psit college of higher education
            and I'm in my 2nd year of studies.</p>
        <p>💻 I have hands-on experience with programming languages like <strong>C</strong>,
            <strong>C++</strong>,<strong>Bootstrap</strong> and <strong>Python</strong>. I enjoy solving problems and
            writing clean, efficient code.</p>
        <p>🌐 I'm also learning frontend technologies like <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> to build
            responsive and user-friendly web pages.</p>
        <p>🧠 I’m exploring frameworks and tools to expand my development capabilities, and I'm always looking for ways
            to grow as a developer.</p>
        <p>🚀 Open to internships, freelance projects, and opportunities where I can apply and improve my skills!</p>
        🚀 I’m a passionate frontend developer with experience in building modern, responsive, and accessible
        websites.<br><br>
